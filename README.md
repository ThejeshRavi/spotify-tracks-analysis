# spotify-tracks-analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a **Spotify dataset** containing detailed information about tracks, albums, and artists using **SQL**. It involves an **end-to-end process**, including **normalizing a denormalized dataset**, executing SQL queries of varying complexity. The primary objective is to enhance **advanced SQL skills** while extracting meaningful insights from the data.

```sql
-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```
## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, it‚Äôs important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

### 4. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into **easy**, **medium**, and **advanced** levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

#### Easy Queries
- Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
  
#### Medium Queries
- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
  
#### Advanced Queries
- Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization.

### üéØ Key Learnings
- Mastered SQL window functions for ranking & cumulative calculations
- Learned how to normalize denormalized data
- Practiced query optimization to handle large datasets efficiently
- Gained insights into music streaming analytics

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- PostgreSQL (Database & SQL queries)
- pgAdmin / DBeaver (SQL Query Editor)
- GitHub (Version Control)
